# pru14: Data and analysis of Malaysian GE14
#### *Author: Kevin Soo*

This contains code for scraping results from the 14th General Election held on May 9, 2018. Code is scraped using R from the [Undi.info](https://undi.info/) portal.

Data for use are found in the following files:
* `ge14_results.csv` contains the raw data
* `ge14_results_w_stats.csv` contains the raw data with statistics I computed

The data was used for writing [GE14: A Statistical Snapshot](https://kevinsoo.github.io/BetweenTwoWaves/posts/ge14-a-statistical-snapshot.html) on [my blog](https://kevinsoo.github.io/BetweenTwoWaves/). The post can be republished using the RMarkdown file.
